Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne illness in the US and case numbers have been rising steadily since 1995^1^. Infected ticks bite their host and transmit bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi that cause infection. In the US, Lyme disease was first acknowledged in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut when many children were diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, an uncommon disease^2^.  Lyme disease is often characterized by a large bulls eye rash.

Common symptoms of the disease include: fever, severe fatigue, chills, muscle and joint aches, headache, and swollen lymph nodes^3^. The highest time for infection is during the spring and summer when ticks are alive and in abundance. Part of understanding this disease and spreading awareness is visualizing where cases are clustered and how that changes over time. Cases are increasing and it is important to know if that increase is in the same areas or new areas. This project has interactive maps of the prevalence of Lyme disease in the US from 1992-2011 on state and county levels. Data was downloaded from the CDC and contained counts of Lyme disease for each county in the US. The maps show relative high prevalence of Lyme disease in the northeast and north midwest. Maps of population density and percent of population under 18 were created. Since ticks are more common in wooded areas, I would have expected ruralness (as estimated by population density) to somewhat match the map of Lyme disease prevalence. However, it seemed that areas of greater population density actually mapped better. Since children most likely play outside more frequently than adults, I wanted to determine if Lyme disease was more prevalent in areas with a higher percent of children. This does not seem to be the case based on the maps except in the lower southwest. Limitations of this work include underreporting of cases, collecting of surveillance data based on county of residence, but not necessarily exposure, and changes in reported cases from year to year cannot be extrapolated to correspond directly to changes in incidence due to factors influencing a states' reporting^4^.
